## üß™ Troubleshooting

- ‚ùå **Token not working?**
  - Make sure it's a user token, not a bot token. (Again, self-bots violate Discord ToS.)

- üßº **Reinstall dependencies**
  ```bash
  pip uninstall discord.py-self
  pip install discord.py-self
  ```

- üõë **Permission errors?**
  - Ensure your account has access to the messages or channels you're trying to log.
